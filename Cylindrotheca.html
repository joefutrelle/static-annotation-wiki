(1)  Hasle & Syvertsen state:  "The identification of C. closterium  may have caused more problems and more confusion than the  identification of any other diatom encountered in marine plankton (see  Lennoxia faveolata and Phaeodactylum tricornutum).  When working with  coastal material, the most common problem is distinguishing between C.  closterium and the coarser N. longissima; examination of water mounts  is usually not sufficient.  Not too thoroughly acid-cleaned material  is better since this often shows the two delicate valves and the many  bands of C. closterium lying together, seemingly twisted around each  other in the rostrate ends."<br>
(2)  Hoppenrath & Drebes (2009) state:  "When identified as a living  cell in water mounts it is nearly impossible to distinguish this  species [C. closterium] from the slightly coarser Nitzschia  longissima.  Most probably our registration of the taxon comprises a  mixture of both species."<br>
(3)  Thomsen et al (1993) state:  "The size and shape of Lennoxia  faveolata looks surprisingly similar to certain planktonic marine  diatoms of Nitzschia subg. Nitzschiella.  However, the ultrastructural  details of the valve face discernible only with TEM differentiates  this taxon from all other diatom genera."   -  bottom line:  see their  plates - in the electron microscope, this is an extremely distinctive  diatom.<br>
